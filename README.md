  Dancing Lights is a project that I worked on during the University of Texas at Austin’s Academy for Women summer program. The Academy for Women program took place from June 7 till June 11, from 1:30pm-5:00pm. Along with three other girls and under the mentorship of a staff member, I worked to create this project. We programmed lights to “dance” to background music, using the C++ programming language and an online Arduino Uno kit from Tinkercad.
